# Codsoft-Projects-Python
 During my internship at CodSoft, I worked on a To-Do list application using Python. I created a GUI with Tkinter to manage tasks, including features for adding, deleting, saving, and marking tasks as completed with checkboxes. This project enhanced my skills in GUI development, task management, and file handling in Python.
